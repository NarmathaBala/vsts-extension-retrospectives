## Background

Retrospectives is an Azure DevOps extension. Visit [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/?view=vsts) to learn more about developing extensions.

## To contribute

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new local branch from the 'master' branch. Follow the 'users/{alias}/{nameofyourbranch}' naming convention for your branch.
3. Publish the newly created branch to the Retrospectives repo. Use this branch as your working branch.
4. Once you are ready to check-in, create a pull request against the 'master' branch. Link the Bug/Task that you are fixing/adding to the pull request. Reviewers will be added automatically.

## Development on Windows

### Clone repo

Clone the repository to your local machine from the Azure DevOps endpoint.

### Build and Test

**Note:** You will need NodeJS to be able to build the project and download dependencies. Go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download NodeJS.

**Note:** The project uses webpack for module bundling. Refer to the webpack documentation [here](https://webpack.js.org/).

- Clone this repo and open it with Visual Studio or with Visual Studio Code. You can also use any IDE or editor that you normally use to work with C# and React/Typescript.

- Using Powershell, navigate to the '/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend' folder, run `npm install`. This will download all the dependent packages listed in 'package.json'.

- Run `npm run build` to build the project. Refer to the 'scripts' section in 'package.json' for other commands.

- To test your changes, you will need to publish a new extension under a new Azure DevOps publisher account. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=vsts) on publishing extensions. You can publish it to any test Azure DevOps organization that you are an admin of (As a Microsoft employee, you can create a new test organization from your Azure DevOps profile page). Currently this is the only way to test the extension.

- Update the 'vss-extension-dev.json' file with the new publisher that you setup. Also update the name and id fields.

```json
{
  "manifestVersion": 1,
  "id": <any new id>,
  "publisher": <the new publisher you created>,
  "version": <your staring version>,
  "name": <your extension's name. Can be any name you can identify by. Eg. Retrospectives-test>,
}
```

- Run `npm run pack:p` to package the modules into a Azure DevOps extension package. This generated package has a '.vsix' extension. This package is generated using information from the manifest file and your built code. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/manifest?view=vsts) to know more about extension manifests.

- [Publish your to the marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=vsts#publish). Once published, share the extension with the newly created test org. See [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=vsts#share) for documentation on sharing.

- Once the extension has been shared with your test org, you can install it to your org and start using it. This installation process is similar to installing any other DevOps extensions. Refer to [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/marketplace/install-extension?view=vsts) for instructions. Since the extension is still in preview mode, it needs to be enabled for the Azure DevOps project. Enable the extension from the 'Preview Features' tab.

- Now start using the extension to test your changes.

- For updates, simple rebuild and package your extension and publish an update from the Azure DevOps marketplace. That will automatically update the extension in your project.

- For the real time live syncing to work, our service needs to know your publisher id and your extension's unique key. To enable real time updates for your test extension, please [reach out to us](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/issues) with your publisher id and the unique key of your extension. [Instructions on how to download the unique key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/auth?view=vsts#get-your-extensions-key).

### Test using Hot Reload and Debug

Test changes by directly load changes locally without having to re-package and re-publish the extension in the marketplace. 

**Note:** You will need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and the [Debugger for Firefox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firefox-devtools.vscode-firefox-debug) VS Code extension.

- In the 'RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend' folder, create the 'vss-extension-dev.json' file using the template. 

- Update the 'package.json' file for the webpack to be in developement mode.

  ```json
      "build": "set NODE_ENV=production && rm -rf ./dist && webpack --mode=development"
  ```

- Update the 'webpack.config.js' to enable source maps. Set the devtool property to `inline-source-map`. You will also want to set devServer.https to true and devServer.port to 3000.

  ```js
      module.exports = {
        devtool: 'inline-source-map',
        devServer: {
          https: true,
          port: 3000,
          static: {
            directory: path.join(__dirname),
          }
        },
      ...
  ```

- By default, webpack serves its compiled, in-memory files directly under `localhost:3000` but the extension is looking for files in the `dist` path. To fix this discrepancy, set `output.publicPath` to `/dist/` in the webpack config. Now webpack will serve files from `localhost:3000/dist` and your extension should load correctly.

```js
    module.exports = {
        output: {
          publicPath: "/dist/"
          // ...
        }
        // ..
    };
```

- Navigate to the '/RetrospectiveExtension.Frontend' folder, run `npm install` to download all the dependent packages listed in 'package.json'.

- Run `npm run build` to build the project.

- Run `npm run start:dev`to start the webpack-dev-server

- Start debugger (making sure the webpack-dev-server is still running). The default launch configuration should be set to Launch Firefox.

- Once Firefox starts up, you should get an untrusted certificate error page. Select Advanced and then select **Accept the Risk and Continue** and log into your Azure DevOps account. From now on, if you leave this Firefox window open, the debugger will reattach instead of starting a clean Firefox instance each time.

- Once you are logged in to Azure DevOps, your extension should be running. Set a breakpoint in a method in VS Code and you should see that breakpoint hit when that method executes.

### Storage

The Retrospectives tool uses the [Azure DevOps data service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/develop/data-storage?view=vsts) for handling all its storage.

### Backend

The Retrospectives tool uses the [Azure SignalR service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/signalr-service/) to add real time support. The backend codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives/tree/master/RetrospectiveExtension.Backend).

## Style Guidelines for Backend Project

Follow the coding guidelines here - [C# Coding Conventions (C# Programming Guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).

## Pull Request Process

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new local branch from the 'master' branch. Follow the `<alias>/<nameofyourbranch>` naming convention for your branch.
3. Publish the newly created branch to the Reflect Backend repo. Use this branch as your working branch.
4. Once you are ready to check-in, create a pull request against the 'master' branch. Link the Bug/Task that you are fixing/adding to the pull request. Reviewers will be added automatically.
5. Ensure builds are successful and tests, including any added or updated tests, pass prior to submitting the pull request.
6. Update any documentation, user and contributor, that is impacted by your changes.
7. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off from one developer from the [Retrospectives team](retrospectives@microsoft.com), or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code

1. The project is developed using the [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/) development platform. The 'CollaborationStateService' web project contains the code for the backend service. Since .NET Core is platform independent, project can be developed on any operating system.
2. The 'ReflectBackend.ReflectHub' class contains the implementation of all the functions that the backend service supports. New methods should be added here to support more real time scenarios.
3. Examples:
   - The code snippet below provides a method that the client can use to join a backend Group. Groups in SignalR provide a method for broadcasting messages to specified subsets of connected clients. Any client using this method gets added to the group that it specifies by the reflectBoardId.

     ```csharp
         /// <summary>
         /// Adds the client to the group for this reflect board.
         /// </summary>
         /// <param name="reflectBoardId">The id of the reflect board.</param>
         public Task JoinReflectBoardGroup( string reflectBoardId )
         {
             _insights.TrackEvent("Adding client to board");
             return Groups.AddToGroupAsync( Context.ConnectionId, reflectBoardId );
         }
     ```

   - The code snippet below broadcasts that a new Feedback specified by the 'feedbackItemId' is available on the board specified by 'reflectBoardId'. The 'columnId' specifies which column of the board the item was added to. Clients can use this method to signal to other clients that a new Feedback was added to one of its boards.

     ```csharp
     /// <summary>
     /// Broadcast receiveNewItem to all other clients viewing the same reflect board.
     /// </summary>
     /// <param name="reflectBoardId">The id of the reflect board.</param>
     /// <param name="columnId">The id of column this item is associated with.</param>
     /// <param name="feedbackItemId">The id of the new feedback item.</param>
     public Task BroadcastNewItem( string reflectBoardId, string columnId, string feedbackItemId )
     {
         _insights.TrackEvent("Broadcasting new item");
         return Clients.OthersInGroup( reflectBoardId ).SendAsync( "receiveNewItem", columnId, feedbackItemId );
     }
     ```
